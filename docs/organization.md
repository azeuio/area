# Area Organization

## Milestones

- Defense plan: due 2023-12-05

Goal: Have experimented with various technological stack and languages and choosen the best one to do the job for your team.

Furthermore it is expected that we separated the project into multiple tasks, that task are scheduled in time and that the work organization between the members of the group is defined.

A PoC of the project in the selected language wil be appreciated.


- Defense MVP: due 2023-12-13

Goal: demonstrate that we were able to realise the core architecture of the project and implemented the base concepts (make different APIs interact with each other).

- Defense Final Product: due 2024-01-08

Goal: have finished the project with the most features possible (different types of services, intersting interactions, good user interface, deployment using docker, ...).

## Tasks

Project have been separated into tasks using a [Github Project](https://github.com/users/Hugoguiheneuf/projects/15/views/2), issues and milestones.

We did a first repartition of the tasks, but we will probably change it during the project.

## Method

We will use the Agile method to develop our project.
The method will highly ressemble the SCRUM method.

With the exceptions being that:
- "Sprints" won't necessarily be the same length.
They will be pretty shorts and agile.
- We won't do a daily meeting because we are a small team and we are always in contact.
- Every task of the "backlog" is already assigned to a member of the team.
- Everyone is a developer, there is no "Product Owner" or "Scrum Master".

However, we will do:
- sprints plannings
- sprints
- sprint reviews (+restrospectives)

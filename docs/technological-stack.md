## Back-end

- Server: `Nest.js`

Tried with 'Django' but Nest.js is simpler to use and contains all the features and pros we need.

First of all, Nest.js use TypeScript, which is a good way to avoid bugs and to make the code more readable, it is also used for the front-end.

Nest.js is a framework from the Node.js ecosystem, which is largely used and has a lot of packages with a lot of features.

The scalability of Nest.js is also a good point, it is easy to add new features and to maintain the code.

The community is very active and there is a lot of documentation.


- Database: `Firebase`

Firebase is a comprehensive platform for building web and mobile applications, mainly used for authentication and real-time database.

Firebase offers a real-time NoSQL database, allowing you to build applications with real-time data synchronization across clients. This is especially useful for applications where multiple users need to interact with and receive updates in real-time.

The Firebase Authentication service is a free service that provides secure authentication and authorization services for application. It supports authentication using passwords, phone numbers, popular identity providers like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and more.

The integration of Firebase with Nest.js is very easy and there is a lot of documentation.

## Front-end

- Web client: `React.js and TypeScript`

React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and it has become widely popular for developing dynamic and interactive web applications

React is component-based, meaning that each UI element is a self-contained module that manages its own state, logic, and lifecycle. This encapsulation allows you to build complex UIs from simple building blocks.

The community is very active and there is a lot of documentation.

React has a rich ecosystem with a wide range of third-party libraries and tools. This ecosystem can help developers address common challenges and speed up the development process.

The integration of React with TypeScript gives us a more robust code and a better development experience, it will force us to write maintainable code.

- Mobile client: `Flutter`

Flutter is a UI toolkit developed by Google for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. We will only use it for the mobile client.

Flutter is a cross-platform framework, which means that you can write a single codebase for both Android and iOS apps. This is a huge advantage for the project because we will only have to maintain one codebase.

Based on the Dart programming language, Flutter is easy to learn and use. It also has a rich set of customizable widgets and built-in tooling.

The hot reload feature of Flutter allows you to instantly view the changes you make to the code in the app. This can significantly speed up the development process.

Same as the other technologies, the community is very active and there is a lot of documentation.
